![Rendered example of RPi Pico Debugger Shoe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShawnHymel/rpi-pico-debugger-shoe/master/images/rpi-pico-debugger-shoe-3d.png)

Stackable debugger board for the Raspberry Pi Pico. Solder long headers to this debugger board in order to connect the Pico to it. You will also need to connect jumper wires from the bottom CLK, GND, DIO pins to the target pico.

All design files were created using KiCad v5.1.
